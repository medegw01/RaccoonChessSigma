## Pull Request Checklist :
* Rebase to the current main branch before submitting your pull request.
* Commits should be as small as possible. Each commit should follow the checklist below:

  - For code changes, add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature
  - Pass the GitHub test - includes spell checks, testing, etc
  - Commit header (first line) should convey what changed
  - DCO Signed 


## Signing your commits

We require that developers sign off their commits to certify that they have permission to contribute the code in a pull request. This way of certifying is commonly known as the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/). We encourage all contributors to read the DCO text before signing a commit and making contributions.

To make sure that pull requests have all commits signed off, we use the Probot DCO plugin.

#### Signing off a commit

Using the git command line
Use either `--signoff` or `-s` with the commit command. See this [document](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/) for an example.

Make sure you have your user name and e-mail set. The `--signoff` or `-s` option will use the configured user name and e-mail, so it is important to configure it before the first time you commit. Check the following references:

* Setting up your github user name [reference](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/)
* Setting up your e-mail address [reference](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git/)

In practice, just add a line to every git commit message:

Signed-off-by: Jane Smith jane.smith@example.com Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).
