# Contributing to RaccoonChessSigma

RaccoonChessSigma is a MIT Licensed project and uses the standard GitHub pull requests process to review and accept contributions.

There are several areas of RaccoonChessSigma that could use your help. For starters, you could help in improving the sections in this document by either creating a new issue describing the improvement or submitting a pull request to this repository.

- If you are a first-time contributor, please see [Steps to Contribute](#steps-to-contribute).

  Use the **[Ask a Question](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ask-a-question.md)** template and fill out the required fields.

  fix - if applicable. You can reach RaccoonChessSigma maintainers on the [mailing lists](mailto:michael.edegware@gmail.com?subject=[RaccoonChessSigma]%20<replace%20me%20with%20more%20specific%20subject>)
